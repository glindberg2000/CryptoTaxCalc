# Active Context

## Current Status
**Phase**: Project Initialization  
**Date**: Starting development based on completed PRD v1.0  
**Status**: Setting up project structure and development environment

## What We're Working On Now
1. **Memory Bank Setup**: Establishing documentation system for development continuity
2. **Project Structure**: Creating initial directory structure and core files
3. **Git Repository**: Setting up version control and initial commit
4. **Documentation**: Creating README and project documentation

## Recent Changes
- Reviewed and analyzed complete PRD document
- Identified core requirements and technical architecture
- Ready to begin Phase 1 development

## Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1 - Core Development)
1. **Project Structure Setup**:
   - Create main package directory: `cryptotaxcalc/`
   - Set up core modules: `parser.py`, `fmv_fetcher.py`, `fifo_manager.py`
   - Create CLI entry point and configuration files

2. **Core Parser Implementation**:
   - CSV loading and validation using pandas
   - Transaction chronological sorting
   - Basic data cleaning and spam filtering

3. **FIFO Logic Implementation**:
   - FIFO queue management using collections.deque
   - Asset tracking and lot matching
   - Pre-2024 holdings integration

4. **Basic Tax Calculations**:
   - Capital gains/loss calculation
   - Short-term vs long-term classification
   - Income event handling

## Development Approach
- **Modular Design**: Build core as importable Python module
- **Test-Driven**: Write tests alongside core functionality
- **Iterative**: Start with MVP CLI, expand to GUI later
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive docs for handoff capability

## Key Dependencies for Phase 1
- Python 3.12.3 environment
- Core libraries: pandas, numpy, collections
- Testing framework: pytest
- Version control: Git

## Success Metrics for Current Phase
- Core parser can load and process sample CSV files
- FIFO queues correctly manage asset holdings
- Basic gain/loss calculations produce accurate results
- Unit tests achieve >80% code coverage
