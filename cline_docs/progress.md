## Current Blockers
- None identified at project start

## Recent Milestones
- âœ… PRD completed and reviewed
- âœ… Memory bank system established
- âœ… Git repository initialized

## Next Critical Milestones
1. **Week 1**: Core parser processes sample CSV files
2. **Week 2**: FIFO calculations produce accurate results
3. **Week 3**: Basic CLI generates usable reports
4. **Week 4**: Test suite validates core functionality

## Success Metrics Progress
- **Accuracy Target (95%)**: Not yet measurable (no code)
- **Performance Target (<5 min for 5K tx)**: Not yet measurable
- **User Satisfaction Target (NPS >8)**: Pending beta release

## Risk Assessment
**Current Risk Level**: Low
- Strong foundation with complete PRD
- Clear technical architecture
- Well-defined phases and milestones
- Adequate technical documentation

**Potential Risks for Phase 1**:
- CSV format variations from real-world data
- FIFO logic complexity for edge cases
- Performance issues with large datasets

## Resource Requirements
- Development time: ~4-5 weeks for MVP
- Testing data: Sample CSV files with known outcomes
- API access: Etherscan, CoinGecko (free tiers sufficient for MVP)
