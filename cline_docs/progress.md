- [ ] Create `requirements.txt` with dependencies
- [ ] Set up `setup.py` for package configuration

🔲 **CSV Processing Foundation**
- [ ] Implement CSV loading with pandas
- [ ] Add data validation and cleaning
- [ ] Create transaction sorting by date
- [ ] Add spam filtering logic

🔲 **FIFO Queue Management**
- [ ] Implement FIFO queues using `collections.deque`
- [ ] Create asset tracking system
- [ ] Add pre-2024 holdings integration
- [ ] Build lot matching for disposals

🔲 **Basic Tax Calculations**
- [ ] Capital gains/loss calculation logic
- [ ] Short-term vs long-term classification
- [ ] Income event categorization
- [ ] Edge case handling (dust, rounding)

### Phase 2: FMV Integration (1 week) - 0% Complete
**Priority**: High - Required for accurate calculations

🔲 **API Integration**

- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

### Phase 5: GUI Prototype (Future) - 0% Complete
**Priority**: Low - Enhancement

🔲 **Streamlit Interface**
- [ ] File upload interface
- [ ] Progress indicators
- [ ] Interactive report viewing
- [ ] Configuration management

## Current Blockers
- None identified at project start

## Recent Milestones
- ✅ PRD completed and reviewed
- ✅ Memory bank system established
- ✅ Git repository initialized

## Next Critical Milestones
1. **Week 1**: Core parser processes sample CSV files
2. **Week 2**: FIFO calculations produce accurate results
3. **Week 3**: Basic CLI generates usable reports
4. **Week 4**: Test suite validates core functionality

## Success Metrics Progress
- **Accuracy Target (95%)**: Not yet measurable (no code)
- **Performance Target (<5 min for 5K tx)**: Not yet measurable
- **User Satisfaction Target (NPS >8)**: Pending beta release

## Risk Assessment
**Current Risk Level**: Low
- Strong foundation with complete PRD
- Clear technical architecture
- Well-defined phases and milestones
- Adequate technical documentation

**Potential Risks for Phase 1**:
- CSV format variations from real-world data
- FIFO logic complexity for edge cases
- Performance issues with large datasets

## Resource Requirements
- Development time: ~4-5 weeks for MVP
- Testing data: Sample CSV files with known outcomes
- API access: Etherscan, CoinGecko (free tiers sufficient for MVP)
